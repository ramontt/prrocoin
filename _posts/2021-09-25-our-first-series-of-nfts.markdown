I guess there's not much to say, really. We're just trying to get our *art* out there
and finance our ongoing projects through these NFTs.

If you like 'em, *please* **[buy 'em][buy-website]**.

Our project's name is [prrocoin][prrocoin-website] (pronounced "perrocoin" in spanish).
We're a mexican artists collective with interest in crypto and *much* love for prros üê∂
